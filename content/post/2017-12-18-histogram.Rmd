###Histograms

First, you need to load the necessary packages:
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
library(sqldf)
```

Now, pick the parameter you'd like to look at, which here is weight for all players:
```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight
 FROM Master"

 result<-sqldf(query)
```

Last, create a bar plot for frequency of all weights in the Lahman database:

```{r}
ggplot()+
   geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="white",bins=50) +
   ggtitle("Body weight")
```
