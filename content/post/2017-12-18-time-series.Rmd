###Time Series

First again, we need to load the necessary packages:
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
library(sqldf)
```

Pick the data we want, in this case number of home runs Babe Ruth made each year he played baseball:
```{r}
 query<-"SELECT yearID,HR
 FROM Batting
 WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

 result<-sqldf(query)
```
 
 Last, here is how to make a time series chart with this information:
```{r}
 ggplot()+
   geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
   geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
   ggtitle("Ruths Homeruns")+
   xlab("Year")+
   ylab("Homeruns")
```
