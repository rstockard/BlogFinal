It's good to start out with loading packages every time you start a project, just be sure everything is there and roped in with the library:
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
library(sqldf)

Here is the search for data for our bar plot.  We are looking for all the stolen bases each year by one player, loftoke01:
query<-"SELECT teamID,sum(SB) AS total_SB
FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='loftoke01'
GROUP BY teamID
ORDER BY sum(SB)"

result<-sqldf(query)

Here's the preliminary coding for a bar plot:
result$teamID<-factor(result$teamID,levels=result$teamID)

And now the bar plot itself:
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=result,aes(x=teamID,y=total_SB),stat='identity')
